This is a website to create and run credits for film/tv. It can either be run in browser or used with a casparCG template which can be downloaded via the page

### Create & Edit ###

* Credits can be created and edited via the GUI
* Credits are saved as a JSON file which can be edited manually and be reuploaded
* Once a project has been created you can enter edit mode to edit, rearange and style the credits
* Custom settings can be added to every bit of content in every project in the form of custom CSS rules, this could be different fonts, coloured backgrounds etc
* Media files must be uploaded for them to work in browser, they must also be downloaded when used with casparCG

### Gallery ###

* Now featuring a gallery where you can see fonts and images
* Allows uploading and deleting of fonts and images

### Online running ###

* Full screen the web browser
* Click the "Run in Browser" button
* In the new popup window click "Toggle UI" to hide the menu bars in the browser window
* When ready to play the credits click "Run"

### Rendering ###

* Now features and FFMPEG based rendering mechanism, it's very CPU intensive due to the nature of generating media from HTML
* Requires FFMPEG to be installed to work

### Using casparCG ###

* Download the template
* Load template into casparCG
* Rest of the process I can't remeber... Will update next time I have caspar and the template in front of me
