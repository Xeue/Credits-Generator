This is a website to create and run credits for film/tv. It can either be run in browser or used with a casparCG template which can be downloaded via the page

### Create & Edit ###

* Credits can be created and edited via the GUI
* Credits are saved as a JSON file which can be edited manually and be reuploaded
* Once a project has been created you can enter edit mode and add blocks that can contain one of each media format
* Custom settings can be added to each credits in the form of custom CSS rules, this could be different fonts, coloured backgrounds etc
* Media files must be uploaded for them to work in browser, they must also be downloaded when used with casparCG

### Online running ###

* Full screen the web browser
* Click the "Run in Browser" button
* In the new popup window click "Toggle UI" to hide the menu bars in the browser window
* Set the duration of the scrolling section by filling in the text box and pressing "Set Time"
* When ready to play the credits click "Run"

### Using casparCG ###

* Download the template
* Load template into casparCG
* Rest of the process I can't remeber... Will update next time I have caspar and the template in front of me
